Home Solutions E-Commerce Platform

Author: Dominic Cash

Overview 

Home Solutions is a lightweight, Java-based e-commerce web application designed to manage and sell home appliances. Built using the com.sun.net.httpserver package, it provides a simple server-side solution for browsing products, managing a shopping basket, and administering inventory. The application features a modern, consistent UI with a gradient background, Poppins font, and green buttons, styled uniformly across all pages.

This project demonstrates core web development concepts including HTTP request handling, SQLite database integration, session management with cookies, and basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for product management.
